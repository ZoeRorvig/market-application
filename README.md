    Similar applications often fail provide a secure environment for community users. Online marketplaces tend to be plagued by scams and false advertisment. During the creation of this application data security has been made a priority and includes authentication processes to protect our users. 

    This application was construted using a number of frameworks, including: JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js & Sequelize. SellOut uses the design language Materialize CSS for much of the application's visual styling.
