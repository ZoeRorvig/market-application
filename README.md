## Description

    Introducing SellOut the newest marketplace app here to make your online shopping experience secure, fast and easy! Use SellOut to offload and sell your unwanted goods and/or buy someone else's with just the press of a button. Users will find SellOut's layout to be aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate so that anyone can be apart of the community. 

    Similar applications often fail provide a secure environment for community users. Online marketplaces tend to be plagued by scams and false advertisment. During the creation of this application data security has been made a priority and includes authentication processes to protect our users. 

    This application was construted using a number of frameworks, including: JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js & Sequelize. SellOut uses the design language Materialize CSS for much of the application's visual styling.
